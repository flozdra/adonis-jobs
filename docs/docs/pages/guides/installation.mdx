# Installation

Since `@nemoventures/adonis-jobs` supports both BullMQ and BullMQ Pro, you need to install the appropriate package based on your needs.

```bash
# For BullMQ (open-source version)
npm install bullmq
# For BullMQ Pro (enterprise version)
npm install @taskforcesh/bullmq-pro
```

## Install package

:::warning[Note]
Make sure you have already installed and configured `@adonisjs/redis` in your AdonisJS application, as this package relies on it for connection management.
:::

Install and configure the package in your AdonisJS application.

```bash
node ace add @nemoventures/adonis-jobs
```

This command will:
- Install the package
- Create the queue configuration file at `config/queue.ts`
- Set up the necessary providers/commands in your `adonisrc.ts`

## Directory path

After installation, you need to create a directory for your jobs and configure it in your `adonisrc.ts` file.

### 1. Create the jobs directory

First, create the `app/jobs` directory in your project:

```bash
mkdir app/jobs
```

### 2. Configure the directory path

Add the jobs directory configuration to your `adonisrc.ts` file:

```ts
export default defineConfig({
  // ... existing code ...
  directories: {
    jobs: 'app/jobs',
  },
  // ... existing code ...
})
```

This tells AdonisJS where to find your job files when using the `node ace make:job` command.

## Verify Installation

Create a test job to verify everything is working:

```bash
node ace make:job test
```

This should create a job file at `app/jobs/test_job.ts`. If successful, you're ready to start using the package!

## Next Steps

Now that you have the package installed, learn how to [configure queues and workers](/guides/configuration) for your application.
